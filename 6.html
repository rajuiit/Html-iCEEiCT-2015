	<b>Brief biography</b>
	</br></br>
	 <div align="justify">
	Prof. Shorif received his PhD and Master from Japan and B.Sc. Engg. from BUET in 2002, 1999 and 1991, respectively. He joined in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Jahangirnagar University, Dhaka in 1992 and currently serves as a Professor of this department. He began his teaching career in 1991 as a Lecturer of the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology (CUET). He undertook postdoctoral researches at Bioinformatics Institute, A-STAR, Singapore, Toyota Technological Institute, Japan and Kyoto Institute of Technology, Japan, Chiba University, Japan. His research is motivated by applications in the fields of image processing and computer vision. He has published more than 50 papers in peer-reviewed international journals and conference proceedings. He holds two patents for his scientific inventions. He received the Best Paper award in the International Conference on Informatics, Electronics & Vision (ICIEV2013), Dhaka, Bangladesh and Best Presenter Award from the International Conference on Computer Vision and Graphics (ICCVG 2004), Warsaw, Poland. He is the co-author of three books and also a member of IEEE, SPIE, IEB and IACSIT.

<b>Enabling Biological Discoveries Through Bio-Imaging Informatics</b>

</br></br>
 <div align="justify">
The entry of imaging into light microscopy serves as a powerful and indispensable tool for making important biological discoveries, which ultimately has given rise to a new branch of bioinformatics research known as Bio-Imaging Informatics. This talk is concentrated on two imaging informatics projects.

One is on microscopy image restoration and the other is on 3D image reconstruction.  Microscopy image suffers from a fundamental problem of poor contrast with increasing depth, as the illuminating light gets attenuated and scattered and hence cannot penetrate through thick samples. The resulting decay of light intensity varies exponentially across the image. The classical space invariant deconvolution methods are not suitable for the restoration of uneven illumination in microscopy images. In the first project we have developed a novel physics-based approach to solve this intensity degradation problem.

 In the earth we find only two kinds of organisms: prokaryotes and eukaryotes. There are vast differences in the cellular structures of these two organisms. It is widely believed that eukaryotes are considered to have evolved from prokaryotes. To confirm this belief we need intermediate form of organisms between them.

Deep sea is one of the most likely environments to find such organisms. Therefore, in the second project we have attempted to do 3D cellular structure reconstruction of deep-sea organisms. It will ultimately lead us in answering the great biological question: what is the evolutionary pathway from prokaryotes to eukaryotes? </td>
