	</br></br>
	 <div align="justify">
	Dr. Mufti Mahmud received Bachelor degree from University of Madras, and Masters degree from University of Mysore both in Computer Science under the Cultural Exchange Programme (CEP) scholarship from the Government of India. He further pursued a Second Level Masters Bio-NEMS/MEMS from University of Trento, Italy where he worked on fabrication of DNA microarrays. He received Ph.D. degree from University of Padova, Italy in Bioengineering where he worked on Brain-Chip Interfacing. He completed Postdoctoral training at NeuroChip lab, University of Padova, Italy for two years and currently working as a Marie Curie Research Fellow at the Theoretical Neurobiology and Neuroengineering Lab, University of Antwerp, Belgium. Dr. Mahmud holds Assistant Professor position at the Institute of Information Technology, Jahangirnagar University, Bangladesh, and visiting positions at NeuroChip Lab, University of Padova, Italy, and COSIPRA Lab, University of Stirling, UK. Dr. Mahmud is Associate Editor of Springer’s Cognitive Computation journal, editorial board member of Advances in Robotics and Automation (OMICS) and Journal of Information Technology (JU), and in committees of numerous conferences in different abilities. Dr. Mahmud has 1 patent and over 40 scientific articles published in leading international and national journals and conferences. His fields of research are high resolution brain-chip interface, neuronal signal processing, brain-machine interfacing, and intelligent system development for neuroscience applications.

<b>Demystifying Neuronal Networks In-Vivo: A Computational Approach</b>
</br></br>
 <div align="justify">
Cognition is one of the main capabilities of mammal brain and understanding it thoroughly requires decoding brain’s information processing pathways which are composed of networks formed by complex connectivity between neurons. Mostly, scientists rely on local field potentials (LFPs) averaged over a number of trials to study the effect of stimuli on brain regions under investigation. However, this may not be the right approach while trying to understand the activation of exact neuronal network generating signals. The LFPs are lumped activity of neuronal populations and their shapes provide fingerprints of the neuronal network generating them. The talk will guide through a method for decoding neuronal networks based on shapes of the LFPs. Briefly, the method extracts shape information from the LFPs, estimates corresponding current source densities (CSDs), calculates signal propagation latencies for different events present in the LFPs and CSDs, and based on the extracted information recreates the underlying network activity. Through neuronal LFPs recorded from rat barrel cortex using high resolution multi-transistor array probes, it has been found that differences in the LFP shapes lead to activation of different neuronal networks.
