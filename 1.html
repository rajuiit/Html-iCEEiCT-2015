Yoshinori Kuno received the B.S. degree, the M.S. degree, and the Ph.D. degree in 1977, 1979, and 1982, respectively, all in electrical and electronics engineering from Tokyo University. In 1982, he joined Toshiba Corporation. From 1987 to 1988, he was a Visiting Scientist at Carnegie Mellon University. In 1993, he moved to Osaka University as an associate professor in the Department of Computer-Controlled Mechanical Systems. Since 2000, he has been a professor in the Department of Information and Computer Sciences, Saitama University.

<b>Lecture Summary: Robotic Systems Based on Sociological Interaction Analysis</b>
</br></br>
 <div align="justify">
Research on human-robot interaction has been gaining popularity as a key technology to realize friendly robotic systems coexisting with humans. Humans would be able to respond to intelligent agents like robots in the same manner as with humans. Therefore, we have been working with sociologists on human interaction.  We take the following three-step approach in our research. We first examine human-human interaction by sociological interaction analysis. And then, based on the findings, we develop robotic systems. We then finally evaluate the robots interacting with humans again by sociological interaction analysis. In this talk, we introduce three robotic systems developed through this approach: a museum guide robot, a care robot, and a robotic wheelchair.
[Museum Guide Robot] Human guides use nonverbal behaviors such as gaze to attract visitors' attention and to effectively explain exhibits.  We have developed a museum guide robot that can use nonverbal behaviors in the same way as humans and performed experiments in a real museum (Fig. 1).
[Care Robot] We have developed a service robot that can provide assisted-care, such as serving tea to the elderly in care facilities (Fig. 2). In multi-party settings, a robot is required to be able to deal with requests from multiple individuals simultaneously. Although the robot serves one person at a time, we show that the robot can manage multiple people with little frustration by showing acknowledgment of their requests through nonverbal behaviors
[Robotic Wheelchair] We have developed a robotic wheelchair, which can autonomously move with a caregiver (Fig.3).  It moves alongside a caregiver because sociologists pointed out that when a wheelchair user is accompanied by a companion, the latter is inevitably seen as a caregiver. In other words, the equality of the relationship is publicly undermined when the wheelchair is pushed by the companion.
