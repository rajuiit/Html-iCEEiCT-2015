	<b>Brief Biography</b>
	</br></br>
	 <div align="justify">
	A. B. M. Harun-ur Rashid has received B.Sc. in Electrical & Electronic Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) Dhaka, Bangladesh in 1984, M.Sc. in Electronic Engineering from Oita University, Japan in 1988 and Ph.D. in Electronic Engineering from University of Tokyo, Japan in 1996. He has been serving as faculty member in the Department of Electrical & Electronic Engineering at BUET where he is a Professor since 2006. He also served as Design Engineer at Texas Instruments Japan Ltd. (1988-1993) where he worked on the research and development of 1.2µm Bi-CMOS process for mixed signal VLSI circuits. He was also a Research Fellow at Research Center for Nanodevices and Systems, Hiroshima University, Japan (2001-2003) where he worked in the design and demonstration of on-chip wireless interconnect. His main research interests are : high speed and low power circuit design using novel Nanodevices, very high frequency analog integrated  circuit design,  on-chip wireless interconnect design etc

<b>VLSI Design in Nanoelectronics Era : Opportunities and Challenges</b>
</br></br>
 <div align="justify">
Successful demonstration of world first working integrated circuit by Jack kilby in July 1958 and two years later the fabrication of first working MOSFET in 1960 by Martin Atalla and Dawon Kahng of Bell Labs created huge enthusiasm among engineers and scientist as they felt themselves closer to reality to build small size integrated circuit using smaller and cost effective MOS transistor. Realizing the huge potential of the technology for miniaturization, Gordon Moore, Co-founder of Intel Corporation, predicted in 1965 that number of transistors on a chip will double in every two years which is known as the famous Moore’s Law. This was the driving force of the semiconductor industry which tried to stay on the Moore’s curve for its survival. As a result the number of transistors on a chip has increased from a few thousands in 1970 to a billion to-day and at the same time the MOS transistor gate-length has reduced from few micrometers to few nanometers.

Continuous scaling of MOS transistors up to 10 nm regime will lead devices to its physical limits. As a result further shrinking of conventional device seems not to be possible. To overcome this and to continue further shrinking of device sizes researchers are working on new generation of innovative devices : Memristor, CNT, Graphene and Spin MOS devices are a few examples. To incorporate these devices into integrated circuit for higher speed and functionality is the challenge for the next generation VLSI design. In this presentation challenges and opportunities of VLSI design in nanoelectronic era will be highlighted.
