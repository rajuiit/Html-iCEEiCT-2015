	<b>Brief biography</b>
	</br></br>
	 <div align="justify">
	Dr. Nowshad Amin is a Professor at the Dept. of Electrical, Electronic & Systems Engineering of The National University of Malaysia (@ Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia), where he also leads the Solar Photovoltaic Research Group at the Solar Energy Research Institute (SERI). After the higher secondary education from native country, Bangladesh, he received the Japanese Ministry of Education (MONBUSHO) scholarship, where he achieved a diploma in Electrical Engineering (1994) from Gunma National College of Technology, Bachelor (1996) in Electrical & Electronic Engineering from Toyohashi University of Technology, Masters (1998) and PhD (2001) on solar photovoltaic technology from Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo, Japan). His areas of expertise include Microelectronics, Renewable Energy, Solar Photovoltaic Applications and Thin Film Solar PV Development. Additionally, his research focuses on the commercialization of Solar Photovoltaic Products from his patented entities, as such he is also serving as the CTO of a University Spin-off company financed by the Malaysian Technology Development Center (MTDC). He has been serving as the project-leader as well as co-researcher of many government and international funded projects. He has authored more than 200 peer-reviewed publications, a few books and book chapters. He is currently holding a visiting professorship position at the King Saud University of Saudi Arabia. He is actively involved in promoting Renewable Energy to the developing countries in South and South East Asia, working as an enthusiastic promoter for the affordable solar photovoltaic technologies.

<b>Thin Flim Photovoltaics: Potentials of Cadmium Telluride.</b>
</br></br>
 <div align="justify">
Over the past few decades, we have seen tremendous growth of solar photovoltaic technology mainly due to the achievement in higher conversion efficiency with decreasing production cost. As a result, manufacturers around the globe could facilitate the way to tremendous market growth (over 40% per annum) of PV applications and make it possible as one of the potential alternative energy resources with benefits manifold. The choice shifts from conventional solar cells, which are in particular crystalline silicon based solar cells, to many other possibilities including thin film photovoltaics such as CdTe, CIGS and so on. Owing to the advantages of simpler, cheaper and faster deposition processes, as compared to traditional crystal silicon based solar cell technology, especially CdTe based cells have drawn much attention having the largest PV industrial production at the lowest cost of USD 0.75 reported in 2010, which has also demonstrated the highest thin film solar cell efficiency of 20.4% in laboratory to date. This talk will include the past, present and future trend in R&D on CdTe thin film solar cells on the perspective of research opportunities as many issues are still unsolved that are making this arena quite interesting to research community.
