    <td><b>Brief biography</b></br></br> <div align="justify">Dr.Rabbani taught Electronics and Medical Physics in the Department of Physics, Dhaka University, Bangladeshfrom 1978 to 2008. A Professor since 1988, he has founded a new post graduate department of Biomedical Physics & Technology emphasising research in 2008 where he currently supervises 15 PhD/MPhil students and Research Fellows. Professor Rabbani has published more than 80 scientific papers, one text book, and has written chapters in 5 books besides supervising more than 80 M.S. thesis students. Having obtained a PhD in Microelectronics from University of Southampton, UK in 1978, he felt his efforts should be targeted to the alleviation of sufferings of the common people in his country, and in the Third World through technology. This led him to work in various areas like solar energy, Biomedical Physics, Biomedical Engineering & Technology, domestic and professional electronic products, all appropriate for a Third World country like Bangladesh. Concurrently he has been actively involved in the design and development of products based onhis own innovationand their successful dissemination through commercial manufacture for which he turned himself into a part time entrepreneuras well. He has a number of innovations in all the sectors that he worked in and some of his technology innovations are in use in UK, Norway, Korea and Pakistan.Professor Rabbani is considered an expert in technology based small industry in Bangladesh and was an active member of the National SME Taskforce formed in 2004, and is a member of the SME Foundation. He organised several associations related to Electronics and Healthcare technology and is the current President of Bangladesh Medical Physics Association (BMPA) and Relevant Science & technology Society, Bangladesh (RSTS). He has given more than 60 invited lectures at home and abroad and has a philosophy of not patenting his inventions, rather he would make these open once matured. The main aim is to bridge the global technology gap through which he feels,the global disparityin economy and quality of life can be alleviated to a great extent.

<b>Indigenous Development of Electro-Medical Devices at Dhaka University</b>
</br></br> <div align="justify">
ECG and X-ray equipment were invented more than a century back, but 80% of the global population living in the Third World is yet to get their benefits. These two examples are enough to speak of the failure of the current commercial model for dissemination of medical devices, in which most of the equipment are developed and manufactured in the rich industrially developed countries, rest of the world depending on them. A solution to this global problem is only possible if medical equipment are manufactured in each country, preferably through indigenous R&D.

This realisation made the author’s team at Dhaka University and their associates design several medical devices which are being used in hospitals, clinics or by patients themselves. Most of these are Electro-Medical devices and these include, i)Computerised EMG/Nerve conduction equipment (routinely being used over 25yrs), ii)Computerised ECG (>1yr),  iii)Computerised dynamic Pedograph (routinely used in a foreign hospital for 4yrs), iv)Iontophoresis equipment for treatment of excessive sweating (being used by hundreds of patients over 15yrs), v)Muscle & Nerve stimulator (being used by physiotherapists over 15yrs), vi) Telemedicine system including software for expert consultation and prescription, which includesECG, Microscope, Stethoscope and General purpose camerathat can be used to capture dermatological images, digitize X-ray films, and to capture hand written records. The costs are significantly lower than that of similar imported ones.

The author’s team is also carrying out R&D on a number of areas where the outcomes of their innovations have drawn international attention with several already taken up by researchers in advanced countries as well. These include i) Focused Impedance Method (FIM), an electrical impedance technique which is being tried for application in the detection of childhood pneumonia, localized lung ventilation andcervical cancer; in the measurement of stomach emptying, stomach acid secretion, abdominal subcutaneous fat thickness and blood vessel stiffness;in the characterization of breast tumour, ii) Distribution of F-Latency (DFL), a new nerve conduction parameter which has been established to give Distribution of Conduction Velocity (DCV) of large motor fibres in a nerve trunk for which no clinically suitable method was available before. This has been used to detect cervical and lumbo-sacral spondylotic neuropathy at an early stage making it a potential screening tool in peripheral neuropathy.

The author’s group is not patenting their innovations. They intend to open up the technology once mature so that persons in other Third World countries can provide similar services to their own people.
